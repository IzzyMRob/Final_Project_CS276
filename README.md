## Game Overview
In 1976 Will Crowther created the game Colossal Cave Adventure, also known as Adventure. This was one of the first text-based games ever created, and it pioneered the genre of "adventure" games.

In 2024 I re-created the functionality of this game for her final project in CS 151 at Willamette University. I also created my own story to go with it, chosing a Sci-Fi Horror theme instead of the original fantasy one.

Now, I am working on turning my version of this game from a text-based implementation to a 2D one. The game is focused on exploration and learning things about your environment, rather than combat like many modern games. 

### Controls
- Use WASD to move up/down/left/right
- Use E to interact with your environment
- Use TAB to open the inventory menu
- Use ESC to pause the game

### How to Play
Welcome to Cosmic Adventure! You are a lone scavenger exploring an abandoned freighter in hopes of finding a wealth of credits, though it is rumored that this ship met a deadly fate.
This place is said to be perilous, the perfect oppurtunity for a daring explorer like you to loot. 
It's important to remember that freighter passages turn a lot, and that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south, although it often works out that way. 
You'd best make yourself a map as you go along.
